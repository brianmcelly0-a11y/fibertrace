* Manual override allowed
* Power propagation uses the route order

### **4.3 Route Reporting**

System generates:

* Total length
* Number of nodes
* Number of closures
* Power loss summary

---

# 🔵 **5. NODE / POLE MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW**

Nodes include poles, handholes, mini-cabinets.

### Steps:

1. Add node by map or GPS
2. Enter node type
3. Assign to route
4. Add power info (if applicable)
5. Add attachments (closures, splitters, cables)

Nodes can contain multiple entities.

---

# 🔵 **6. CLOSURE MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW**

Closures include:

### **6.1 Adding a Closure**

1. User chooses type
2. Places on map
3. Fills details:

   * Fiber count
   * Splitters
   * Cable entries
   * Location type (pole/ground)
   * Route
   * Photos
4. Save

### **6.2 Closure Interaction**

Tap → popup showing:

* Power status
* Splicing diagram
* Connected routes
* Condition
* Maintenance history

---

# 🔵 **7. SPLICE MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW**

User selects closure → “Add Splice”

### Inputs:

* Fiber In → Fiber Out
* Color code
* Tube number
* Splicing type
* Loss reading
* Photos

### System:

* Builds a virtual splice map
* Updates power chain
* Highlights bad joints or high-loss fibers

---

# 🔵 **8. SPLITTER & POWER FLOW WORKFLOW**

### **Splitter Mapping**

User selects type (1×4, 1×8, 1×16 etc)

System prompts:

* Input fiber
* Output branches
* Customer or route assignments

### **Power Propagation**

System reads:

* Input power
* Splice losses
* Splitter losses
* Cable attenuation (per km)

Then calculates:

* Power at every closure
* Power at every customer
* Alerts if below threshold

---

# 🔵 **9. CUSTOMER DROP / ONT MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW**

### Add Customer:

1. Place marker
2. Assign customer number
3. Choose parent FAT or splitter
4. Enter drop length
5. Enter ONT power reading
6. Save

System updates:

* FAT consumption
* Splitter output load
* Power chain
