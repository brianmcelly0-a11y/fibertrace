✖ Check for common project setup issues
The .expo directory is not ignored by Git. It contains machine-specific device history and development server settings and should not be committed.
Advice:
Add ".expo/" to your .gitignore to avoid committing local Expo state.
✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in /home/expo/workingdir/build/app.json:
 Field: ios - should NOT have additional property 'supportsTabletMode'.
Error validating asset fields in /home/expo/workingdir/build/app.json:
 Field: Android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage - image should be square, but the file at './public/assets/fiber-bg.png' has dimensions 1408x768.
 Field: icon - image should be square, but the file at './public/assets/fiber-bg.png' has dimensions 1408x768.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/
✖ Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: react-native-gesture-handler
Required by: @react-navigation/stack
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.
✖ Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK
Expected package @expo/config-plugins@^7.8.0
Found invalid:
  @expo/config-plugins@54.0.2
  @expo/config-plugins@54.0.2
  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/config-plugins)
Expected package @expo/prebuild-config@^6.7.0
Found invalid:
  @expo/prebuild-config@54.0.6
  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/prebuild-config)
Advice:
Upgrade dependencies that are using the invalid package versions.
✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  expo-constants@18.0.10 - expected version: ~15.4.6
  expo-font@14.0.9 - expected version: ~11.10.3
  expo-location@19.0.7 - expected version: ~16.5.5
  expo-splash-screen@31.0.11 - expected version: ~0.26.5
Your project may not work correctly until you install the correct versions of the packages.
Found outdated dependencies
Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
